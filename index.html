                    <p>I am a Computer Science major at Lewis & Clark College. I have just recently retired from football after finishing up my 10th and final season. Now my direction has shifted into establishing myself as programmer. I would like to work in some sort of development, whether that be Web Development, Software Development, or Game Development. I would also be willing to try my luck out in some sort of hands on IT positions. For fun I like to spend time outdoors, and partake in extreme sports such as Snowboarding, Riding Dirtbikes, etc. I try to be a very active person, and always looking for a way learn and better myself</p>
